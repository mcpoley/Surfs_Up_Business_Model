# An Analysis of June and December Temperatures For the Surf's Up Business Model 

## Purpose

W. Avy, a business investor is trying to determine the best location for his surf and ice cream business model to thrive. One main concern is the temperature variations by month in Oahu, Hawaii. Because we have access to the Hawaii SQLight database, we can derive key queries that will greatly aide in this endeavor.  Using a decoupled system, we can create different classes in our code to reference the various tables in the database

## Results: 

The temperature statistics are summarized in the tables bellow. 

•	As expected, the average Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit for December is lower than for June, but only by 3 degrees. An average temperature in the low seventies bodes well for a Lū’au style business model even in a winter month. 





•	There appears to be slightly more temperature variance in the winter month than in the summer. The maximum and minimum temperatures differ from the mean by factors of 12 and 15 in December respectively. In comparison, June max and min temperatures vary from the mean by factors of 11 and 10 respectively. This discrepancy is reiterated by a slightly higher standard deviation for the December month (3.75 vs 3.26). Differing factors like this can add unpredictability and instability to a business model.

•	A significantly higher temperature is, of course, more conducive to a surf and ice-cream model. A max of 85 (as shown in June) will likely drive out customers to the cooler water and refreshing dessert. A minimum temperature of 56 (as is present in December) on the other hand will likely cause customers to remain in doors. The month of December thus has temperature extremes more favorable to the surf and ice-cream experience. 

## Summary:

Overall, it is predicted that business will grow substantially in the June. The mean temperature is ideal for outdoor services, and the temperatures remain relatively steady throughout the month. The maximum and minimum temperatures of 85 and 64 will probably not hinder traffic in any significant way. Expectedly, business will drop in the month of December, as the temperatures are less constant. Unpredictability in the weather adds risk to a company banking on out-door conditions.  The lower winter temperature is also less friendly to surfing and ice-cream. 

## Discussion:

Other queries could be made to establish ideals for the experience such as precipitation, wind, cloudiness, or humidity. There are problems with temperature relationships that we established for the two months. One is that there ended up being more observations for the month of June than for December (1700 vs 1517). In order to make a more statistically accurate comparison, we would need a higher sample group for December. In a similar manner, as of 2017, the last year in the analysis, June data was available while December data was not. This being the case, the June temperature analysis has a whole month of data that the December analysis was lacking. Once more data is collected for December, a more precise correlation between the two months can be determined.
